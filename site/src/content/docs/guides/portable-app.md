# Install the portable app

Nostekon can run as a downloaded local application. Its Go executable serves
Studio in your browser; no hosted account or public server is required. A
dedicated desktop window is not implemented. The portable evidence app needs
neither Docker, Python, Node nor Go at runtime.

Verified on Linux on 2026-10-09: executable-relative Studio discovery from a
different working directory, loopback defaults, version/help, HTTP capabilities
and graceful interrupt shutdown. Six OS/architecture packages can be built.
Windows and macOS are cross-build targets, not locally verified executions.
There is no renamed Nostekon release yet; historical `v0.1.0` predates it.

## Obtain a matching build

Use a successful **Studio** job in the repository's
[CI workflow](https://github.com/jagarkarlo/nostekon/actions/workflows/ci.yml).
Its `nostekon-app-linux-amd64` artifact contains the Linux archive and checksums.
GitHub may require sign-in to download CI artifacts; artifacts expire after
seven days. A tag release will provide persistent platform-specific assets.
Do not use an older Checkride artifact as a current Nostekon installation.

Alternatively, from this checkout with Go 1.25, Node 22, npm and Bash:

```bash
npm ci --prefix studio
npm run build --prefix studio
NOSTEKON_VERSION=dev NOSTEKON_APP_TARGETS=linux/amd64 \
  bash scripts/build-app.sh
```

The output is in `dist/app/`. Available targets are `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`,
`darwin/amd64`, `darwin/arm64`, `windows/amd64` and `windows/arm64`. Omit
`NOSTEKON_APP_TARGETS` to build all six; Windows packaging also requires `zip`.
`amd64` is x86-64, including most Intel/AMD PCs; `arm64` includes Apple Silicon.
Check the machine you will run on, not just the build host.

## Verify and extract

Obtain the archive and its `SHA256SUMS` together from a trusted source. On Linux:

```bash
cd dist/app
sha256sum --check SHA256SUMS
mkdir nostekon-local
tar -xzf nostekon-app_linux_amd64.tar.gz -C nostekon-local
cd nostekon-local
./nostekon-api --version
./start-nostekon.sh
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8080`. Keep the terminal open; Ctrl+C stops the app.
The launcher uses its own directory, so it works from another working directory.
On macOS use the matching `darwin` archive and
`shasum -a 256 --check SHA256SUMS`.

Windows packages are ordinary ZIPs. Verify the selected file in PowerShell:

```powershell
Get-FileHash .\nostekon-app_windows_amd64.zip -Algorithm SHA256
Expand-Archive .\nostekon-app_windows_amd64.zip .\nostekon-local
Set-Location .\nostekon-local
.\nostekon-api.exe --version
.\nostekon-api.exe
```

Compare the hash with the matching line in `SHA256SUMS`. `Start-Nostekon.cmd`
also starts the app from its own directory. These binaries are not OS-signed;
SmartScreen or Gatekeeper may block them. Do not bypass organizational security
controls. Use an approved source build or Docker when appropriate. Checksums
detect transfer damage, not publisher identity or recovery success.

## Configure and identify

```bash
./nostekon-api --help
./nostekon-api --addr 127.0.0.1:8181
./nostekon-api --studio-dir /path/to/studio --addr 127.0.0.1:8181
./nostekon-api --api-only
```

Stop an existing invocation before starting the next. `--addr` overrides
`NOSTEKON_ADDR`; default is `127.0.0.1:8080`. Studio is selected from
`--studio-dir`, then `NOSTEKON_STUDIO_DIR`, then `studio/` beside the executable.
`--api-only` suppresses configured and bundled Studio; it cannot be combined
with `--studio-dir`. Missing optional bundles retain API-only behavior, while
invalid existing bundles fail startup. Studio roots remain filesystem-confined.

**About Nostekon** shows the build, engine, actual lab capability and
browser-storage origin. `GET /api/v1/info` exposes build/capability metadata,
not local paths or keys. `--version` does not start the server.

The app has no authentication: keep it loopback-only. Explicit wildcard addresses
are allowed for container wiring, not permission to expose it publicly. Lab
execution is disabled unless a Linux host explicitly configures the trusted
executable, private data root and loopback listener in the
[lab runbook](k3d-isolated-restore.md#run-the-suite-from-studio).

## Back up before moving

Saved runs, suites and public-key trust belong to the browser origin: scheme,
host and port. Use the same address after restarting. Changing ports does not
automatically migrate that library.

In Runs, **Back up saved runs** exports `nostekon-runs.backup.json`: exact evidence
and optional sidecars, with SHA-256 for both originals. **Restore run backup**
validates hashes, asks for confirmation, evaluates every run, then saves the
batch atomically. Invalid input, failed evaluation and quota/capacity failures do
not partially replace the library. Existing evidence identities can be updated;
other runs are not deleted. Backups are bounded to 64 MiB and 50 runs.

Reports, sample labels, public keys, verification receipts and trust are not
backed up. Restored evidence is Imported, even if originally an example.
Re-import authenticated public keys separately and make a fresh signature check.
Unsigned backup updates preserve an existing sidecar. Saved suites and host-job
history are separate; export their original files with existing controls. A run
backup is not Import bundle or Import signed archive. Protect sensitive backups.

## Troubleshoot safely

| Symptom | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Address already in use | Stop the process you own or choose an unused loopback port; do not kill an unknown service. |
| Studio missing | Keep extracted `studio/` beside the binary, or select its root with `--studio-dir`. |
| Permission denied or OS blocks launch | Check the source and organizational policy; do not bypass security controls. |
| Empty library after moving | Reopen the old browser origin and export before clearing site data. |
| Restore error | Keep originals, address the reported limit/evaluation/quota error and retry; no pruning occurs. |
| Signature cannot verify | Authenticate/import the correct public key, explicitly grant trust and recheck exact originals. |

To uninstall, stop the app and remove the extracted directory. Browser data is
separate; export and verify originals before deliberately clearing site storage.
No service, automatic updater or background installation is created.
